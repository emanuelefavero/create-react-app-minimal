# Create React App --template minimal

This is a minimal template for a **React App** using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
It is useful for quickly creating a new app without all the extra stuff that comes with the default Create React App template.
It was created with React 18.2 in 2022.

_NOTE: Things may have been changed since then._

## RUN APP

    ```bash
    npm i
    npm start
    ```

## TIP

To choose a specific project name for your React App using this template, simply add your desired project name (e.g. my-app) during the clone command

`git clone https://github.com/emanuelefavero/create-react-app-minimal.git my-app`
